        <h3>And they lived...</h3>
        <p> I have been married for almost 3 years and have loved every moment of it. The second
            week we were married we adopoted our dog Leia. Just a week before we honeymooned to Flordia and 
            visited Disneyworld. There in a gift shop we came across an adorable Star Wars dog colar. However
            at the time we didn't have a dog. After we returned home. I went onto KSL and 
            there just two listings down was Leia. We brought her home that night.

        <p>
            My wife Rachel graduated with her Masters from the U of U in Psychology. She 
            is not a fully licensed thearpist and is working in her field. This has always 
            been a dream of hers. Helping other people find happiness in dark times and places.
            I am constantly taking advantage of her skills and am always learning from her. 
            We both met at a Halloween party dressed as Robin <i>(Batmans Sidekick)</i>. For all you 
            DC nerds she was dressed as <i>Jason Todd's Red Hood</i> and I was dressed as <i>Dick Grayson.</i>
            We ran into each other a few more times and destiny told me that it was no coinidence. 
         </p>

         <h3>Leia</h3>
         <div class="altImage"><img src ="Images/Leia.jpg" alt="Leia" ></div>
         <br>
         <p>
            Leia <i>(our first dog) </i>is a miniature pincher german shepard. She is actually a rescue from
            a dog fighting arena. What they were doing there I have no idea.
            As soon as we adopted Leia we quickly found she suffered from major seperation
            anxiety. However we also discovered that when she was around other dogs she was 
            no longer stressed about us leaving. This of course led us to the adopting of Rowan.
            Don't let her size fool you, she is very cunnying and 
            and bossy. I never knew dogs could have such a personality until I met her. Both her and Rowan 
            are completely obsessed with playing ball and have little to no desire to 
            play any other games. Her favorite treat is chicken that our Mother in law cooks for
            her almost every Sunday.
         </p>  
 
         <br>
         <h3>Rowan</h3>
         <div class="altImage"><img src ="Images/Rowan.jpg" alt="Rowan" ></div>
         <br>
         <p>
            Rowan is as close to my dream dog as I will ever get. As I had mentioned before about Leia.
            We decided that we needed another dog to keep Leia company. During the pandemic finding another
            dog was no easy task. Anytime we made plans to see a dog, they would be sold within
            the hour. After searching and searching Rachels friend of a friend posted on facebook
            this a picture of Rowan and immediately we decided to go see if we could adopt him. 
            The situation was a bit sad. He was being baby sat every day and locked in a kennel for 
            hours at a time. He was in poor shape and was full of fear and anxiety. However
            within a few weeks, he was put back into shape and much less fearfull. Though we 
            are still working on loud noises. As for Leia, her seperation anxiety is completely gone.
            We can leave the house without so much as a peep from either of our dogs.
