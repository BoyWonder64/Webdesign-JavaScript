            <h3> The Story so far...</h3>
            <p>My name is Maitland Andrus. I was born and raised in Utah. Since I could remember, I have
                been using a computer since I could talk. During my early childhood I spent time
                playing Putt-Putt and Pajama Sam. This fueled my passion for software development.
                During high school, I studied digital media to help improve my creative side.
                After high school, I moved to Spain for a bit and spent time studying Spanish, to which I
                 am now fluent.This taught me that anything I set my mind to, I can accomplish. Though
                At first, programming appeared difficult and impossible. After much research and hard work, I discovered
                I was able to understand, learn, and apply it.  </p>

            <h3>Where am I now...</h3>
            <p>I now work for a company called Motorola Solutions.
                I started out on the patch team. My responsibilities were to prepare our customers' servers for our
                Once the patch was ready, we had to shut down production and manually apply it. Once completed
                We restored service to the system and did our best to resolve and report any issues that arose. After 4
                Years of experience later, a position in QA on our State Link team became available.
                I've been in this position for about a year and am very happy with it. The career path I am following is to
                complete my Bachlors here at Weber State and then transition into a developer position.
