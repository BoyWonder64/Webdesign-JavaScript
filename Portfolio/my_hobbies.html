            <h3>Skiing</h3>
            <p>I have been skiing for only about 3 years now but love. My favorite resport is Brighton Resort.
                My least favorite resort is Solitude. They have to many mogals and it faces the sun so its super iced over. 
                At the time of publishing this. I mostly only ski on green  and blue trails. My wife and I do it any 
                chance we can get up to the Mountains if we cant mountain bike. 
            </p>

            <h3>Mountain Biking</h3>
            <p> During most of the year you can find me up in Park City at the Alpine Trailhead biking
                their trailsystem. I love everything there is to do with Mountain Biking and try to 
                keep fit during the Winter so that I have no difficulty getting started again. I currently
                have a Specialized Enduro Evo (DownHill) its a great bike overall. Though sometimes it feels
                a bit heavy. Of all the hobbies this is my favorite one. The picture you see below was taken 
                of me and my Father in law at Bryan Head going down Bunker Creek.

            <h3>3D Printing</h3>
            <p> A few years back, I started 3D printing with a Creality CR-10 printer. I had it printing 
                almost flawlessly for about 7 - 10 months until one day I could not get it to level for me
                no matter what I did. After selling it, I purchased a CR-6SE (self leveling) and have
                had minimal issues with it since. My favorite things to pring have been masks and little 
                Greek God statues.

            <h3>YouTube</h3>
            <p> Since 2020 I like a lot of other people began to work from home. With my additional 
                free time I applied my knowledge gained in digital media and began editing and 
                making various videos as side projects. After some trial and error I was able to
                make a dream project of mine and have felt content with the state of my page since. 
                I do believe one day when I finish school I will go back to making content.
